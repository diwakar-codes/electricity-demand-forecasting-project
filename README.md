# electricity-demand-forecasting-project
This project is done using XGBoost ml algorithm on dataset Electricity+Demand+Dataset.csv

This project focuses on forecasting electricity demand using time series analysis and machine learning techniques. The objective is to predict future electricity consumption based on historical demand data, enabling better planning and resource management in the energy sector.

Contents
	1.	Data preprocessing and exploration
	2.	Time series feature engineering
	3.	Model training and evaluation using regression techniques
	4.	Comparison of performance metrics such as RMSE and MAE
	5.	Visualization of actual vs. predicted demand

Requirements
	•	Python 3.8+
	•	Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost

How to Run
	1.	Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
	2.	Install the required libraries using pip.
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
	3.	Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells step by step.
	4.	Review the output plots and metrics to analyze forecasting performance.

Future Scope
	•	Incorporating additional external features such as weather data
	•	Testing advanced deep learning models such as LSTM or Transformer-based architectures
	•	Deploying the model for real-time electricity demand prediction
